    VISION STATEMENT

<p>

<h1>
    OUR PHILOSOPHY
</h1>
<p>
    Coen.lije Music Academy offers comprehensive musicianship through active learning for children and adults. Our music educators are highly qualified and share a love of teaching. Our curriculum offers group experiences, private lessons, ensemble participation, theater, and camps. We believe that learning music can be FUN, and we believe in the effectiveness of learning in groups.  Group experiences offer students the opportunity to participate in comprehensive musical learning through shared experiences.
    Most classes and lessons meet once a week, without regular in-class parent participation.  This provides a better learning situation and develops wonderful teacher/student rapport.  Parents are invited for periodic class visits and performances, and participate with productions, fundraisers, and special events.
    Our class curricula have been especially designed for each level, providing appropriate and innovative learning materials for each age group.  Each curriculum provides a logical progression of study as students continue through our courses.
    * Our preschool classes are built on activities including singing, playing, listening, rhythms, and creative movement.
    * Our school-age classes include both large and small group activities, as well as individual projects that foster enjoyment in the process of making music.
    * Our adult classes teach basic skills and understanding, and are welcome to students of all levels.  No previous experience required.
    Most of our class students, whether majoring in piano or not, learn basic piano skills, because the keyboard provides the most graphical representation of how music is organized.
    Our private and small group teachers individualize the approach that best suits each student.  It is important to us that we provide students with a good understanding of music reading, not just playing by finger number, hand position, or rote.  In addition to Just Playing, the basic music-reading method used by the whole school, students will study a variety of repertoire pieces based on their interests and the best choices to help them progress, including classical, folk, and fun music.
    Students are given a range of performance opportunities, including preschool programs, choral festivals and concerts, musical theater productions, student recitals, and community performances.

    ABOUT COEN.LIJE MUSIC ACADEMY
</h1>
<p>
    In 1977, Doris Harry and a small group of music educators sought to create a music school where children could learn about music by exploring, reading, and piano.  Thirteen children enrolled in a twelve-week pilot program.
    Today, Coen.lije Music Academy has an enrollment of over 8000 students throughout the years, and we have taught students ranging in age from 12 months to well over 80 years old. We offer a comprehensive, hands-on approach to musical growth and experiences, which includes listening, singing, rhythmic activities, instrumental instruction, games and music theory.
    Our faculty is made up of highly qualified music educators with extensive teaching and performing experience, with degrees that range from bachelors to doctoral degrees.  All our teachers, staff and assistants share a love of music and children.
    Coen.lije Music Academy alumni are making music from coast to coast, as professionals and as amateurs in orchestras, choirs, operas, and musicals on and off Broadway, and are sharing music as educators, choir directors, band teachers and accompanists.
